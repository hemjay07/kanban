### Motivation

Ever wondered what it takes to develop an intuition for React? This project was born out of that curiosity.

Is it through building multiple complex applications, exploring documentaries, and distilling findings and challenges into articles? I plan to find out.

### Overview

Kanban is a task management app that allows users keep track of tasks in a simple yet all-encompassing way. Task are grouped into columns which represents the status of the task e.g Todo, Doing, Done. Users can have multiple boards for different topics e.g Plaform Launch, Writing.

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Learnt how to use React Hook forms.
- Learnt how to use Redux toolkit.
- Learnt different approach to work with modals in react.

### Continued development

- Create a bankend or use a headless CMS.
- Write unit tests using React Testing Library.
- Create user authentication.

### Takeaways/Lessons learnt

- TypeScript will save you a lot of headaches.
- Take your time to properly set up your the structure of your redux store in way that is easiest to mutate, it is best when most part of the store are decoupled.
- Redux toolkit is a darling.

### Useful resources
